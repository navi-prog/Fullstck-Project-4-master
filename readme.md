<h1>Building an E-Commerce Store Project</h1>

![demo](src/img/screenshot.png)

<h2>About the Project:</h2>

<div>
  <p>
    In this lesson, we got acquainted with React. Now it's time to put it to the test by creating an e-commerce website. This project is divided into two parts.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first part covers the design, where you will build the components and fill in the style file (CSS). Alternatively, you can choose any method to add style to your React application.
  </p>
  <p>
    The second part covers adding state, routes, and event handlers.
